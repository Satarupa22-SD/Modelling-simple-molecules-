# Modelling simple molecules 

Simulating molecules or materials is becoming a mainstay first line of investigation in modern physical chemistry. It provides a materially cheap and rapid method for prediction and validation. Molecular simulations have increasingly important in drug screening, and understanding protein dynamics, with several breakthroughs in recent COVID-19 pandemic being provided by similar computational studies. Molecular modelling has come long way from modelling simple gases, or few hundreds of water molecules to full scale protein simulations consisting of million of atoms. In the current project we would look at some of the very simple tools and principles needed to start understanding molecular dynamics simulations.

First building block for unravelling molecular dynamics can be something as simple as a spring. Under harmonic approximation a simple spring can be used to demonstrate numerical solution methods for differential equations, signal processing and Fourier transform, limitations of numerical methods, and estimation of molecular properties.

## Research Objectives: 
The broad aim of this project is to teach students about the utility of computational tools in estimating the physically observed properties. This project shall also introduce to the fundamentals of numerical methods, namely Hessians, autocorrelations, and Fourier series, Differential equations. 

- **Objective 1** : Learning the fundamentals of modelling using simple particle on a spring. This introduces to the concept of numerical solution to differential equations, physical nature of differential equations, numerical differentiation and integration, Euler method, and a brief introduction to higher order solvers. It shall also introduce to Taylor series expansion. Using simple plotting tool we should be able to generalize to linear motion as well. 

- **Objective 2** : Modelling molecule as a multiple interlinked springs. Modifying the previous lesson by providing two particles attached by a spring. Both symmetric and unsymmetric molecules to be shown. HH, HF, then for tetra-atomic molecule Ammonia. Introduce force fields,  and other tricks like water models. 

- **Objective 3** : Small intro to ensemble and importance of averaging with importance of statistics in statistical mechanics (Only demonstrations). Comparison of water models using freezing and melting of ammonia. Also possible intro to gases like Krypton? 

- **Objective 4** : Using autocorrelation function, or Hessian, and Fourier transform, calculate IR spectra, and match with literature. Introduce to overall efficacy of classical MD and its limitations. Tell about ab initio MD, and about anharmonicity.
